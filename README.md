# dashend (rewritten)

This repository is a rewritten version of [dashend](https://github.com/RoootTheFox/dashend).

This is rewritten to remove all the unnecessary components, fix potential ratelimiting, and to just function as a verification server. No database required!

It implements [dashauth](https://gist.github.com/RoootTheFox/743c983092b4db2a9fec13341d25b61f) GD-message based authentication for verifying user's GD account access.
